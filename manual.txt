2.0.2:
- save state at end of game
- make verison footer always visible
- editor faster loading
- team color outline around fighter cards
future:
- icons instead of letters for types

entity relations stored as objects while game is running, when saving to file save the id only
entities save the higher relation in hierarchy
- level
- league 
- team
- player
- game
- fighter

rating: a quantitative way to measure an entity's value

fighters: 
currently all types are weighted equally but ideally are weighted by frequency
m = 1 / # of types
rating = base + (strength * m) - (weakness * m)

teams:
average rating of fighters (include wins at some point?)

game:
team1 rating + team2 rating

league:
average rating of teams

rating scale: preserves an entity's rating in its current context
will be used to standardize across tiers and seasons
current scale: average prep rating = 75
ideal scale: average A tier rating = 100

player personalities
