rating: a quantitative way to measure an entity's value

fighters: 
currently all types are weighted equally but ideally are weighted by frequency
m = 1 / # of types
rating = base + (strength * m) - (weakness * m)

teams:
average rating of fighters + (wins * 100) + (ties * 50)

game:
sum of team ratings

league:
average rating of teams

rating scale: preserves an entity's rating in its current context
will be used to standardize across tiers and seasons
current scale: average prep rating = 75
ideal scale: average A tier rating = 100
